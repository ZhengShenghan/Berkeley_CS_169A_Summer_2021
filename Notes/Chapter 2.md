# Chapter 2: How to Learn a New Language

#### 2.1 Prelude: Learning to Learn Languages and Frameworks

8-point plan for learning a new imperative object-oriented language:

1. Types and typing.
2. Primitives. 
3.  Methods.
4. Abstraction and Encapsulation.
5. Idioms
6. Libraries
7.  Debugging
8. Testing.

#### 2.2 Pair Programming

The driver enters the code and thinks tactically about how to complete the current task,
explaining his or her thoughts out loud as appropriate while typing.
The observer or navigator—following the automobile analogy more closely—reviews
each line of code as it is typed in, and acts as a safety net for the driver. The observer
is also thinking strategically about future problems that will need to be addressed, and
makes suggestions to the driver.

#### 2.3 Introducing Ruby, an Object-Oriented Language

Ruby:

1.Everything is an object

2.only a class’s instance methods—not its instance variables—are visible outside the class. all access to instance variables from outside the class must take place via public accessor methods; instance variables lacking public accessor methods are effectively private

dynamically typed

Methods: A method is defined with def method_name(arg1,...,argN) and ends with end

#### 2.4 Ruby Idioms: Poetry Mode, Blocks, Duck Typing

A programming idiom: is a way of doing or expressing something that occurs frequently in code written by experienced users of a given programming language

mix-in:  named collection of related methods that can be added to any class fulfilling some “contract” with the mixed-in methods
